# MusicCampScheduler
Scheduler and dashboard applicaiton for a music camp

This application is still very, very alpha. It is a learning activity for me, I've not done any development in a number of years and wanted to do something on the web. It will be functional with a 1.0 release by the end of 2016, but won't look very pretty. More features and functionality will be written in 2017 when I learn CSS/HTML/JS properly.

Before using this applicaiton, you need to configure your own config.xml. There's an example in here, with all the information you should need. The application is pretty flexible on how long your camp is, and which sessions are held throughout the day.
